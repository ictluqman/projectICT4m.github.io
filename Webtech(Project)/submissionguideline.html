  <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

  <h3>For Paper Submissions</h3>

  <p>All paper submissions will be handled electronically. Papers must be submitted
     electronically in DOC format at <strong>easychair</strong>. Submitted papers must not
     substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are
     simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings.
     Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed and carefully evaluated based on
     originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.</p>

  <p>The submitted papers must be between 4-6 pages.   To facilitate the paper’s
     double-blind peer review process, authors should make efforts to ensure that
     information about the authors’ identities do not appear anywhere in the text-
     body of the paper and must follow the <strong>guidelines</strong>.</p>

  <p>Upon acceptance, at least one of the authors listed in the paper must submit
    the final paper, attend the conference and present the paper according to the
    schedule of the conference. In the event that the presenter is unable to attend
    the conference for any reasons, your accepted paper will not be considered for
    submission of the proceeding to the <strong>IEEE Xplore</strong>.</p>

  <p>Accepted papers after further revisions will be invited for publications in
     selected journals. Please direct any questions about the paper submission
     process to the program chair at <strong>ict4m@iium.edu.my</strong>.</p>

  <h3>No Show Policy</h3>

  <p>Papers that are accepted must be presented at the conference, either by the
    authors themselves or via a proxy. In case a paper is not presented at the
    conference, it shall be deemed a <strong>‘no-show’</strong>. Only presented papers will be
    submitted for indexing. <strong>No refund of the paid fees</strong> may be claimed by the <strong>‘no-
    show’</strong> author.</p>
